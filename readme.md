Certainly! Here's a sample README file for Sprint 1 of your coursework project:

# Project Name: Sprint 1

## Sprint 1 - Readme

This readme provides an overview of the project, instructions for setting up the development environment, running the application, and the user stories defined for Sprint 1.

### Project Overview

The aim of this project is to develop an application for the smooth and efficient operation of a business. The application will allow easy access to population information using an SQL database provided by the organization.

The project will be developed using the following tools and techniques:

- Front-end: HTML/PUG
- Back-end: Node.js
- Communication: Express.js
- Database: MySQL
- Version Control: Git
- Deployment: Docker

### Setting Up the Development Environment

To set up the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository: [repository_url]
2. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command in the project root directory:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the MySQL database provided by the organization is set up and accessible.
2. Configure the database connection details in the application. Update the configuration file (`config.js`) with the appropriate host, port, username, password, and database name.
3. Start the application by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Open a web browser and access the application at [http://localhost:3000] (assuming the application runs on port 3000).

### User Stories (Sprint 1)

The following user stories are planned for Sprint 1:

1. As a user, I want to view all countries in the world organized by largest population to smallest.
2. As a user, I want to view all cities in the world organized by largest population to smallest.
3. As a user, I want to generate a country report with columns like code, name, continent, region, population, and capital.
